# mnistproject
This is my A level computer science project, which trains a 3-layer neural net through stochastic gradient descent to recognise digits from the MNIST dataset. The user can also draw a digit onto the screen, and the trained network will 'guess' this digit.
I used Numpy to perform the matrix calculations for the weights of the network, a MNIST parser library to load the MNIST dataset into Python, and Pygame for the interface.
